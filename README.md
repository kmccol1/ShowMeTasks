## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the ShowMeTasks application locally.

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher.
- **MariaDB**: Installed and running.
- **Node.js and npm**: Recommended version 14.x or higher for Node.js.
- **Gradle**: Included with the project via the Gradle Wrapper.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ShowMeTasks.git
cd ShowMeTasks
```

---

### 3. Backend Setup (Spring Boot Application)
1. **Navigate to the `backend` folder**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Update Database Configuration**:
   - Locate the `application.properties` file under `src/main/resources/`.
   - Update the following fields with your MariaDB credentials:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/your_database_name
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```
   - Add a **JWT Secret Key** for authentication:
     ```properties
     jwt.secret=your_secret_key
     ```

3. **Start the Backend Server**:
   - Use the Gradle Wrapper to start the Spring Boot application:
     ```bash
     ./gradlew bootRun
     ```
   - The server should start on `http://localhost:8080` by default.

---

### 4. Frontend Setup (React Application)
1. **Navigate to the `frontend` folder**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Use npm to install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Development Server**:
   - Start the React app:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### 5. Verify the Application
1. Open your browser and visit the React frontend: `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Test the backend by interacting with the app or directly accessing API endpoints at `http://localhost:8080`.

---

### 6. Optional: Build for Production
If you want to build the app for production deployment:

#### Backend:
- Package the backend as a JAR file:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew build
  ```
- The JAR file will be located in `build/libs/`.

#### Frontend:
- Build the React app:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- The optimized static files will be located in the `build/` directory.

---

### Troubleshooting
- **MariaDB connection issues**:
  Ensure MariaDB is running, and the `application.properties` file has the correct credentials.
- **Port conflicts**:
  If the default ports (`8080` for the backend or `3000` for the frontend) are in use, update the configuration files:
  - Backend: `application.properties` file (`server.port`).
  - Frontend: Use the `PORT` environment variable when starting the React app:
    ```bash
    PORT=3001 npm start
    


## Usage Guide

1. **Register or Log In**: Access your personalized dashboard.
2. **Create & Manage Task Lists**: Add, edit, or delete tasks within dedicated lists.
3. **Secure Your Session**: Always log out after use to maintain session security.

## Project Structure
